# Software-Watchdog
Team Anant
This is a basic implementation of a software watchdog meant for a Nanosatellite, built for the student satellite team of BITS Pilani (Team Anant).
This code uses Real-time signals provided by Linux OS. Few dummy processes were created and the watchdog successfully killed the processor that took more than the stipulated time. The code is given here, If you see a 404 error, contact the collaborator of the repository.
